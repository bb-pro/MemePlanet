# MemePlanet
Welcome to the MemePlanet app!

This app is designed to provide a simple and fun way to view and share memes with your friends. The app is built using Swift and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for easy maintenance and scalability.

Using this app, you can view a random meme that is fetched from a third-party API. Simply tap the "Get Random Meme" button on the home screen and the app will display a new meme for your viewing pleasure.

In addition to the random meme feature, the app also provides a list of memes that you can view and share. To access the list of memes, simply navigate to the "Meme List" screen in the app. From there, you can browse through the available memes and select the ones you want to share.

To use this app, simply download it from the Github and install it on your device. The app requires an active internet connection to fetch the memes from the API, so make sure you are connected to a reliable Wi-Fi or cellular network.

We hope you enjoy using this app as much as we enjoyed building it. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us. Happy meme-ing!
